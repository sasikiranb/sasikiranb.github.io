The font Veron has three heights: Normal, Bold and Bold Extra: a decorative alternate.

The Veron font is perfect to write titles, names and make posters. The Normal and Bold heights have some alternate characters in the lowercase. The three fonts are kerned. This is the second and last update of the Veron font, I adjusted all glyphs metrics and heights because they were looking weird in some designs.
